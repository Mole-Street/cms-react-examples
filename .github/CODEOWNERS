# Lines starting with "#" are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# More details are here: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/

# The "*" pattern is for global owners.

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.

# Catch-all rule in case changes are made outside of the core implementation folders
